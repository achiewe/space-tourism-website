## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project was a novelty for me as it introduced me to various new functionalities. one notable example is the utilization of the "useParams" and "Link" components from the "react-router-dom" library. by using these components, i was able to retrieve the planet parameter from the current route, fetch the corresponding planet information from a data source, and display the planet's details along with a background image. it was a valuable learning experience that expanded my knowledge of React and its libraries.
